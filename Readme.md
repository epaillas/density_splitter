### Density Split

This set of codes can be used to split the galaxy density field in different quantiles, as in Paillas et al. 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09854)

- generate_positions.py: generates a set of randomly position centres on a simulatio nbox
- calculate_filter.py: calculates the integrated galaxy density at a given distance for each random position
- split_positions.py: splits the positions in different quantiles by using the chosen filter
